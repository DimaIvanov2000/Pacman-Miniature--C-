# Pacman Miniature Recreation

A small-scale, partially functioning version of the game Pacman for the C console.

## How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). A console window should be shown with the classic Pacman board layout in ascii characters.

## How to Play

Movement is done with WASD. The goal of the game is to collect all of the dots (*/o) without getting caught by the four ghosts (@). There are "tunnels" at either side of the map which help the player to avoid ghosts. There is no reward for winning aside from the increasing score.
